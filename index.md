# Earth and Space Science Committee's Trial Resource Center 
<br>

## Welcome
This is a draft site of what our committee's independently run resource site could look like 

- Kristi still testing different github page formats but I may switch to a r/quarto based
- Jekyll and Ruby are having a gem disagreement so ^
- The left hand menu will have parent-child pages for events (instead of the template stuff)

## 2024 Event table 

| Division B | Division C |
| ---------- | ---------- |
|Road Scholar|Geologic Mapping|
|Meteorology|Remote Sensing|
|Dynamic Planet|Dynamic Planet|
|Fossils|Fossils|
